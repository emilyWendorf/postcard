	<p><span>My name is Jennifer Diaz and I am a realtor with Keller Williams Heritage.</span> I have recently sold multiple properties in your neighborhood. I welcome the opportunity to meet with you and go over any real estate needs and update you on the current market for your area. Together we can create a plan, whether you are interested in buying or selling. In this ever-changing market, you need an experienced Realtor who can get your home sold for full market value and in a reasonable amount of time.<br>
